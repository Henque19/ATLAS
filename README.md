Version history

0.11 - Increased tolerences of the feet assembly and outer spectrometer
0.10 - Made part settings more modular and implemented arbitrary cut angle to MirrDupCut
0.9 - All parts are exportable as STLfree. Added 
0.8 - Removed muon tiles (inner barrel) intersecting with tile rails. Added rail support for endcap magnet.
0.7 - Changed MirrorDupCut to mirror along Z instead of rotate Y-axis. Added Tile rail support and muon system options
0.6 - Improved TRT, LAr, EndCap and FCal
0.5 - Added fingers and rendering options for Tile to render LongBarrel or ExtendedBarrel
0.4 - Added defaultRes option to limit number of faces
0.3 - Added rendering options for feet (CERNFeet("RTB") is used to render Rail, Top and Feet respectively)
